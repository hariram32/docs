<!-- @@@title:Pre-built Widgets@@@ -->

LogZilla comes packaged with 12 pre-built widgets. Two for event rates, one for LastN (which can be used as-is, or customized), one for messaging, five system widgets, one for messaging, and two for TopN (also highly customizable).

**Event Rate Widgets** – These widgets give you a quick view of your current and long term event rates. Large changes in these can give indications of changes in traffic, configuration problems, or security events, among other things. Spikes in these graphs should be investigated as a part of routine maintenance.

**LastN Widgets** – The sample widget in this section shows the Most Recent Event Sources. By changing the title and parameters, though, it can display Mnemonics, Hosts, or other data.

**Messaging** – This widget displays the Latest Unread Notifications. Notifications are generated by triggers that users create. See the ["Notifications"](/help/using_notifications_in_log_zilla) documentation for more information.

**System Widgets** – Allow you to monitor the status of your LogZilla server. Options include CPU Load, Memory Usage, Network Utilization, Storage, and Disk IOPS. For high traffic servers that require 100% uptime, these widgets can help indicate issues before they become downtime.

**Tasks Widget** – This will display any tasks created by, or assigned to the user. Tasks can be created on the Tasks page, or by right clicking on relevant events in the search results. See the “Tasks” documentation for more information.
