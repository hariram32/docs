<!-- @@@title:Using The Dashboard@@@-->

In LogZilla 5, we've completely revamped our dashboard. Our widgets now display live data and are customizable in many ways. We've also added system widgets which allow you to monitor your server's resources alongside your event data.

Users with administrative rights to dashboards can create multiple custom dashboards and assign them to users or groups, display relevant data in NOC using TV mode, or monitor network issues in a live stream. The possibilities are limited only by an engineer's imagination.
