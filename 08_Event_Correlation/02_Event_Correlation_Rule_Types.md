Event Correlation Rules
---

LogZilla/SEC includes the following EC Rule Types:

* Single
 - Match input event and execute an action immediately.
* SingleWithScript
 - Match input event and, depending on the exit value of an external script, execute an action.
* SingleWithSuppress
 - Match input event and execute an action immediately, but ignore subsequent matching events for the next `t` seconds.
* Pair
 - Match input event, execute an action immediately and ignore subsequent matching events until some other input event arrives.
 - Upon the arrival of that second event execute another action.
* PairWithWindow
 - Match input event and wait `t` seconds for some other input event to arrive.
 - If that next event is not observed within a given time window, execute an action.
 - If that next event arrives on time, execute another action.
* SingleWithThreshold
 - Count matching input events during `t` seconds
 - If the given `t` threshold is exceeded, execute an action and ignore all matching events during the rest of the specified time window.
* SingleWith2Thresholds
 - Count matching input events during `t1` seconds
 - If a given threshold is exceeded, execute an action and start counting matching events again
 - If the matching event counter per `t2` seconds drops below the second threshold, execute another action.
* Suppress
 - Suppress matching input events (used to keep the events from being matched by later rules).
* Calendar
 - Execute an action only at specific times.
* Jump
 - Submit matching input events to specific ruleset(s) for further processing.
* Options
 - Set processing options for a ruleset.
